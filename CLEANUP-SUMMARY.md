# Repository Cleanup - Summary

## Issue Addressed
The repository contained multiple versions of the website mixed together, causing confusion about which version was the "current" site.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Old Static HTML Site
- **Removed**: `/static-html-site/` directory (entire folder, 49MB)
- **Reason**: This was an abandoned old version of the site, as documented in `CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`

### 2. Build Artifacts in Root Directory
- **Removed**: 
  - `index.html`, `styles.css`, `404.html` - Static build outputs
  - `/_next/` directory - Next.js build artifacts
  - `/fonts/` directory - Compiled font files
  - `/images/` directory - Build-time copied images
  - `next.config.js` - Duplicate config (kept version in `/app/`)
  
- **Reason**: These were build artifacts from Next.js exports that should not be committed to the repository. They are generated during the build process.

### 3. Unused Dependencies
- **Removed**: `/app/prisma/` directory
- **Reason**: Not being used in the current implementation, as noted in deployment checklist

### 4. Unnecessary Archive Files
- **Removed**: 
  - `joniwoods-static-build.tar.gz` (18MB)
  - `CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.pdf`
  - `DEPLOYMENT_UPDATE.pdf`
  - `GITHUB-DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.pdf`
  
- **Reason**: 
  - The tar.gz was an old build archive
  - PDF documentation is redundant (markdown versions are kept and easier to maintain)

## What Was Kept

### Source Code
- `/app/` directory - **The current Next.js application** (this is the modern website)
- All configuration files in `/app/`
- All React components, pages, and styles

### Documentation
- `README.md` (updated to reflect new structure)
- `CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_UPDATE.md`
- `GITHUB-DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `GITHUB-PAGES-SETUP.md`

### Important Assets
- `Joni Woods Media Kit_Final.pdf` - Media kit for promotional purposes

## Updated Files

### `.gitignore`
Added rules to prevent build artifacts from being committed:
```gitignore
# Build artifacts - don't commit static exports to root
/_next/
/fonts/
/images/
/index.html
/styles.css
/404.html
*.tar.gz
```

### `README.md`
- Updated file structure documentation
- Changed from "Static Website" to "Next.js Website"
- Added development instructions
- Clarified that `/app/` is the main source directory

## Repository Structure After Cleanup

```
/
├── app/                          # Next.js application (MAIN SOURCE)
│   ├── app/                     # Next.js pages and layouts
│   ├── components/              # React components  
│   ├── public/                  # Static assets (images, fonts)
│   ├── next.config.js          # Next.js configuration
│   └── package.json            # Dependencies

└── README.md
```

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Single source of truth - the Next.js app in `/app/`
2. **Smaller Repository**: Removed ~70MB of unnecessary files
3. **Better Workflow**: Build artifacts are generated during deployment, not committed
4. **Easier Maintenance**: No confusion about which files to edit
5. **Standard Practice**: Follows Next.js best practices for repository structure

## Deployment Impact

**No negative impact on deployments**:
- GitHub Pages and Cloudflare Pages will build the site from `/app/` directory
- Build process generates the same static files that were removed
- The deployed website will look and function exactly the same

## For Developers

To work with the site:
```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build static export (outputs to app/out/)
```

The build output (`app/out/`) is not committed to git and is generated fresh on each deployment.
