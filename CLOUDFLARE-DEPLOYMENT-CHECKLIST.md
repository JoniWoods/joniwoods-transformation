---

4. ‚úÖ All changes tested and working correctly

---

## üîß Required Cloudflare Configuration Steps

### ‚úÖ STEP 1: Repository Cleanup (COMPLETED)

The following cleanup has already been completed:

1. ‚úÖ `/static-html-site/` directory has been removed
   - Old abandoned HTML site has been deleted

2. ‚úÖ `/app/prisma/` directory has been removed
   - Unused Prisma configuration has been deleted

3. ‚úÖ Build artifacts removed from root
   - `index.html`, `styles.css`, `404.html`, `_next/`, `fonts/`, `images/` removed
   - `.gitignore` updated to prevent future commits of build artifacts

4. ‚úÖ Repository now has clean structure
   - Single source of truth: `/app/` directory contains Next.js application
   - See `CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md` for complete details

**No action needed for Step 1** - The repository has been cleaned up and is ready for deployment.

---

### STEP 2: Update next.config.js (ALREADY CONFIGURED)

**File:** `/app/next.config.js`

‚úÖ The configuration is already correct:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  distDir: process.env.NEXT_DIST_DIR || '.next',
  output: 'export',  // ‚úÖ Already configured for static export
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: false,
  },
  images: { unoptimized: true },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

**No action needed for Step 2** - The Next.js app is already configured for static export.

---

### STEP 3: Configure Cloudflare Pages Build Settings

**Navigate to:**
Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí joniwoods-transformation ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Builds & deployments

**Set these EXACT values:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Framework preset | `Next.js (Static HTML Export)` |
| Build command | `cd app && npm install && npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `app/out` |
| Root directory | (leave blank) |
| Node version | `18` or higher |

**Important Notes:**
- The build command includes `cd app &&` because the Next.js project is in the `/app` subdirectory
- The output directory is `app/out` (not just `out`) for the same reason

---

### STEP 4: Set Environment Variables

**Navigate to:**
Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí joniwoods-transformation ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment variables

**Add these variables for Production:**

1. **NODE_VERSION**
   - Value: `18`
   - Click "Add variable"

2. **NEXT_DIST_DIR** (optional)
   - Value: `.next`
   - This ensures consistent build directory

---

### STEP 5: Trigger Deployment

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
1. After pushing your changes to GitHub (Steps 1-2)
2. Cloudflare will automatically detect the changes
3. A new deployment will start automatically
4. Wait 3-5 minutes for completion

**Option B: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to: Pages ‚Üí joniwoods-transformation ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click "Retry deployment" on the latest build
3. Or click "Create deployment" for a fresh build

---

### STEP 6: Verify Deployment

**Check that the main site loads:**
- URL: `https://joniwoods-transformation.pages.dev/`
- Should show: Joni Woods homepage with book banner at top
- Hero section aligned to top with tight spacing
- All navigation links working
- Images loading correctly

**Check build logs if issues occur:**
- Go to Deployments tab
- Click on the deployment
- View "Build log" for any errors

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build fails with "Cannot find module"
**Solution:** 
- Check that build command includes `npm install`
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Current command: `cd app && npm install && npm run build`

### Issue: 404 error on deployed site
**Solution:**
- Verify build output directory is set to `app/out`
- Check that `output: 'export'` is in next.config.js
- Look for errors in build log about static export

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution:**
- Already configured with `images: { unoptimized: true }`
- If still issues, check that images are in `app/public/images/`
- Verify image paths start with `/images/` not `./images/`

### Issue: Styles not loading
**Solution:**
- Tailwind CSS should compile during build
- Check build logs for PostCSS errors
- Verify `postcss.config.js` exists in app directory

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Build Logs:** Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí View build log
2. **Check Error Messages:** Look for specific error codes or module names
3. **Verify Changes:** Ensure all steps 1-4 are completed exactly as written
4. **GitHub Sync:** Confirm all commits are pushed to main branch

**Current Site Status:**
- ‚úÖ Local preview working: `https://60b614c1e.preview.abacusai.app/`
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Ready for Cloudflare deployment

---

## üìù Notes

- The Next.js project lives in the `/app` subdirectory, which is why all paths include `app/`
- Static export means no server-side rendering (SSR) - everything pre-rendered at build time
- Cloudflare Pages serves the static files from the `out` directory
- The site will be globally distributed across Cloudflare's CDN for fast loading
