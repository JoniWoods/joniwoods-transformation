## ‚úÖ Workflow Configured

## üöÄ How to Enable GitHub Pages (One-Time Setup)

Follow these steps to enable GitHub Pages for the first time:

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/JoniWoods/joniwoods-transformation

2. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure your repository is **PUBLIC**
   - GitHub Pages requires public repos for free accounts
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí scroll to "Danger Zone"
   - If it says "Private", click "Change repository visibility" and make it public

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Click on **Settings** tab (top right)
   - Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
   - Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - Click **Save** if prompted

4. **Trigger First Deployment**:
   - The workflow will automatically run when this PR is merged to `main`
   - Or you can manually trigger it:
     - Go to **Actions** tab
     - Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
     - Click "Run workflow" button
     - Select `main` branch and click "Run workflow"

5. **Wait for Deployment** (2-3 minutes)
   - Watch the Actions tab for the workflow to complete
   - Green checkmark ‚úÖ = successful deployment
   - Your site will be live!

## üîß Build Process
The GitHub Actions workflow will:
- Checkout the repository code
- Upload all static files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.)
- Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically
- No build step needed - the site is already pre-built!

## Manual Trigger
You can trigger a deployment manually at any time:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow on the left
3. Click **Run workflow** button (on the right)
4. Select the `main` branch
5. Click **Run workflow**
